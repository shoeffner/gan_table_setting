# Learning and generating table settings


## Running training

This project uses [sacred](https://github.com/IDSIA/sacred), so running can be done by using the "usual" sacred commands.

```bash
python tablesetting.py print_config  # To see what can be configured
python tablesetting.py  # Just train  -- currently, the environment variables for MONGO (see next section) are required!
```


### Persisting run results using Sacred, Mongo, and Docker

If you have docker and docker-compose, you can spin up MongoDB and Omniboard instances using the `docker-compose.yml` file.
You can then train and store the results to the MongoDB, and inspect the results at your [local omniboard (http://localhost:9000)](http://localhost:9000).
This requires some environment variables.

```bash
export MONGO_HOST=127.0.0.1:27017
export MONGO_USER=user
export MONGO_PASS=pass
export MONGO_DB=sacred

docker-compose up

# in new terminal
export MONGO_HOST=127.0.0.1:27017
export MONGO_USER=user
export MONGO_PASS=pass
export MONGO_DB=sacred

python tablesetting.py
```


### Hyperparameter search

Run the MongoDB as shown above.
Then use `runner.sh` to run a hyperopt-mongo-worker which can optimize the parameters.
Note that this currently relies on a manual workaround if your database uses admin credentials, see [hyperopt/hyperopt#486](https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt/issues/468) for details.
To queue different parameter settings, run:

```bash
python optimize_hyperparameters.py
```

To visualize the results, the `result_server.py` can be used ([http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)).
On startup and every minute, it processes new results coming in from runners.
However, it only forces updates of the most recent result set.
For older result sets (or concurrently running result sets), manual calls are needed:

```bash
python visualize_optimizations.py KEY
```

Where `KEY` is one of the keys stored in `results/runs.list`.
